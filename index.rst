Welcome to the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS Bootcamp! This workbook accompanies an instructor-led session that introduces Nutanix technologies and many common management tasks. Each section has a lesson and an exercise to give you hands-on practice. The instructor explains the exercises and answers any additional questions that you may have.
